# Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Tooltips Not Displaying**
The tooltips were not showing when clicking or hovering on candlesticks.

### **Issue 2: Wick Lines in Candlesticks**
The candlesticks were displaying with wick lines (high-low lines) through them, making them look cluttered.

## Solutions Applied

### **Fix 1: Tooltip Setup Timing**

**Problem**: Tooltips were being set up in the `__init__` method before the chart was fully ready.

**Solution**: Moved tooltip setup to happen after the chart is drawn and ready.

**Before:**
```python
# In __init__ method
# Setup tooltips
self._setup_tooltips()
```

**After:**
```python
# In __init__ method
# Tooltips will be setup after chart is ready

# In force_chart_update method
# Setup tooltips after chart is ready
if not hasattr(self, 'tooltip_annotation') or self.tooltip_annotation is None:
    self._setup_tooltips()
```

### **Fix 2: Removed Wick Lines**

**Problem**: Candlesticks were displaying with wick lines (high-low lines) making them look cluttered.

**Solution**: Removed the wick line drawing code to show only candle bodies.

**Before:**
```python
# Draw the high-low line (wick)
self.price_ax.plot([timestamp, timestamp], [low_price, high_price], 
                 color='black', linewidth=1.5)
```

**After:**
```python
# No wick lines - only candle bodies
```

## Technical Details

### **Tooltip Setup Timing**
The key issue was that tooltips were being set up before the matplotlib figure was fully initialized. The fix ensures tooltips are set up after:
1. Chart is drawn
2. Canvas is ready
3. Figure is fully initialized

### **Wick Line Removal**
The wick lines were being drawn using `plt.plot()` with vertical lines from low to high prices. Removing this code results in:
- **Cleaner appearance**: Only candle bodies visible
- **Better readability**: Focus on OHLC data without distractions
- **Professional look**: Standard trading chart appearance

### **Event Handling**

- **Hover events**: `motion_notify_event`
- **Click events**: `button_press_event`
